Form a library of all moves in the winning tree.

Mark each move with the "best play" expected outcome
(i.e. winner and moves to the win).

Collect statistics for each strategic move:
    tree size (full)
    tree size (actual nodes examined)
    move list (all moves actually used by 1st player)
    Anything else that might support a research effort.
